    "Q1. Flask Framework:\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is designed to be simple and lightweight. It provides the tools and libraries needed to build web applications quickly and easily, while allowing developers to have a lot of flexibility in choosing components and libraries they want to use. Flask is based on the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and is commonly used for building small to medium-sized web applications, APIs, and prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask is designed to be easy to understand and use, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask doesn't impose a specific project structure or set of tools, allowing developers to choose the components they need.\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask provides a simple core and supports extensions for various functionalities like database integration, form handling, and authentication.\n",
    "Minimal Boilerplate: Flask minimizes boilerplate code, which means you can get started quickly without writing a lot of repetitive code.\n",
    "Well-Documented: Flask has comprehensive and well-organized documentation, making it easier for developers to learn and troubleshoot.\n",
    "Community and Ecosystem: Flask has a large and active community, along with a wide range of third-party extensions and libraries available.\n",
    "Now, let's move on to the other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Simple Flask Application:\n",
    "To create a simple Flask application that displays \"Hello World!!\", you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "Unfortunately, I can't attach screenshots here, but you can run this code in your Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment that supports Flask, and it will display \"Hello World!!\" when you access the root URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. App Routing in Flask:\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to defining routes (URLs) that map to specific functions in your application. When a user accesses a specific URL, Flask's routing mechanism determines which function should handle the request. This allows you to create different pages or endpoints for your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Creating Routes for Company Information:\n",
    "Here's how you can create the requested routes in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def company_details():\n",
    "    details = \"\"\"\n",
    "    Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "    Location: India\n",
    "    Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return details\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "Similar to the previous code, you can run this code in your environment to see the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. URL Building with url_for():\n",
    "The url_for() function in Flask is used to build URLs for routes defined in your application. It takes the name of the route function as an argument and returns the URL associated with that route. This is useful because it allows you to create URLs dynamically, even if the route URLs change in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return 'Hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "def show_user_profile(username):\n",
    "    return f'User: {username}'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    with app.test_request_context():\n",
    "        print(url_for('hello'))  # Outputs: /\n",
    "        print(url_for('show_user_profile', username='john'))  # Outputs: /user/john\n",
    "When you run this code, you'll see that url_for() generates the appropriate URLs for the specified route functions. Note that the actual output will be printed to the console, not in the Jupyter Notebook itself."
